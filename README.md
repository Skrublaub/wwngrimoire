# Overview

This is a project for organizing spells from worlds without number.
I will include some of my dm's broken homebrew as well

## How the programming works

The backend will be a python flask server

The frontend will be react.js.

There will be a nonjs version for the privacy lovers out there.
Way less feature packed though.

## TODO

Maybe use async flask?????  
`pip install "Flask[async]"`
