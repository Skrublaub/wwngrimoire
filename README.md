# Overview

This is a project for organizing spells from worlds without number.
I will include some of my dm's broken homebrew as well

## Formatting

This project uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format python code.  
HTML and javascript is formatted with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

Black is installed with the environment. Prettier needs to be installed
manually.  
`npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier`

## How the programming works

The backend will be a python flask server

The frontend will be react.js.

There will be a nonjs version for the privacy lovers out there.
Way less feature packed though.

## TODO

Maybe use async flask?????  
`pip install "Flask[async]"`
