High Mage
A flattened disc of tremendous heat, sound, and shock is
triggered at a visible point within fifty feet per caster level,
erupting in a twenty-foot radius eight feet in height. Everything
within the area suffers 1d8 damage from flame,
concussion, and sonic shock per caster level, with an
Evasion save for half. If used in a space less than 40 feet
in width, the explosion is channeled through adjacent
spaces and passages for an additional 1d6 x 10 feet.
