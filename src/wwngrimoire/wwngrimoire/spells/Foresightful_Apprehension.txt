High Mage
The caster probes the near currents of fate to discern
the likely immediate outcome of an action. The caster
describes a particular action they or a comrade intend to
presently undertake, whereupon the GM tells them what
is most likely to happen in consequence within the first
five minutes after the action, as the GM thinks it most
probable. This spell cannot be used more than once a
week on the same general topic.
